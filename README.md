The IETF Administration LLC has prepared its Draft Strategic Plan 2020 [1].  This is a significant expansion on the previous IETF LLC strategy and is intended to provide a comprehensive strategy both for the 2020 fiscal year and the long term.

The strategic plan is made up of the following elements, all of which are being presented for comment:

1. **Mission**.  This is a literal definition of what the IETF LLC does.  The mission rarely changes in the lifetime of the company.
2. **Values**.  These define how the company behaves as it follows its mission. These may change over time to reflect broader social changes.
3. **Strategic Goals**.  The highest priority goals of the IETF LLC.  These may be short-, medium- or long-term goals or a mix.  These are the big picture of what the IETF LLC is aiming to do in the next 3-5 years and so are the key setting that the board expects the company to follow.
4. **Strategic Transformations**.  These detail the changes that need to be made in order to achieve the strategic goals.   Each transformation details the current state and the desired state to transform into. These transformations should be achievable within 1-3 years.

The consultation on this Draft Strategic Plan 2020 starts at Monday 4 May 00:00 UTC and closes on Monday 1 June 00:00 UTC.  It will be extended if needed.
